# Neutral Cultural Evolution Simulation

This repository contains code for a paper on tests for cultural neutrality.
We intend to implement several tests for neutrality that can be applied to cultural evolution.
We will determine the sensitivity of the tests to deviations from the assumptions of the
infinite alleles model.
